Base.astro centralizes three concerns: Tailwind import, brand header/footer, and canonical tag. Your file already imports Tailwind via a relative path, computes canonical from Astro.url using https://sandiegocommercialmailbox.com, and uses real routes in the nav. Per-page canonicals were removed so the canonical is single-sourced from the layout, avoiding legacy domains and duplicates. The nav enforcement script guarantees /services, /industries, /contact links are routes, not anchors. The diagnose script verifies Tailwind import, canonical logic, Base usage by pages, and that production serves a stylesheet and the correct canonical.
